# Bookflow

A fast, clean Python tool for converting PDF books into well-structured, reflowable EPUBs.

Bookflow reads the text of a PDF book, throws away what only made sense on a printed page
(page numbers, running headers, the printed table of contents), and rebuilds the book as
an EPUB 3: paragraphs that reflow on any screen, one page per chapter, a working table of
contents, linked notes, and verse that keeps its lines.

It is written with Georgian books in mind and handles English too.

## Install

Bookflow needs Python 3.12 or newer.

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/andriaberi/Bookflow
```

Or from a clone, for working on it: `make install` (see [Development](docs/development.md)).

## Use

```sh
bookflow book.pdf
```

This writes `book.epub` next to the PDF and prints what it found:

```
Wrote book.epub: 160 headings, 5977 paragraphs, 206 notes, cover from the PDF
```

### Options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output PATH` | Where to write the EPUB. Default: next to the PDF, with `.epub`. |
| `--pages SPEC` | Convert only some pages, 1-based: `1-3,7,10-12`. |
| `--title TEXT` | The book's title. Default: the PDF's metadata, else the file name. |
| `--author TEXT` | The book's author. Default: the PDF's metadata. |
| `--language CODE` | The book's language, such as `ka` or `en`. Default: the PDF's own language tag, else detected from the text. |
| `--cover IMAGE` | A cover image (JPEG, PNG, ...) for books whose PDF has no cover. A PDF that has one keeps its own. |

Many PDFs have no title or author in their metadata, so the title page would read
`book`. Pass `--title` and `--author` to fix that:

```sh
bookflow ucxo.pdf --title "უცხო" --author "ალბერ კამიუ"
```

## What Bookflow does with a book

- **Cleans the text.** Page numbers, running headers and footers, OCR specks and
  dashes misread as two, words broken at line ends, ligatures.
- **Rebuilds paragraphs** from indents, gaps and short last lines, across page breaks.
- **Finds the book's divisions.** These are volumes, parts, books and chapters, with
  their titles: "ნაწილი პირველი", "თავი მეორე: ...", "Chapter 3". Headings may be
  centred, flush left, flush right or in a bigger font.
- **Builds the table of contents** from those headings and drops the printed one.
- **Drops the printed title page**, since the EPUB has its own.
- **Links notes.** A notes section ("შენიშვნები", "Notes") with `[1] ...` entries
  becomes a notes page, and each mark in the text links to its note and back.
- **Keeps verse and lists line by line**, with stanzas apart.
- **Uses the PDF's cover** when its first page is a picture, or the `--cover` image.
- **Embeds fonts** (Noto Serif, Noto Serif Georgian) so every reader shows the same type.

[How it works](docs/how-it-works.md) explains each step and the rules behind it.

## Limits

- **Scanned PDFs need a text layer.** Bookflow reads text and doesn't do OCR itself.
  Run `ocrmypdf` first.
- **Headings need a label word.** A chapter needs a word like თავი, ნაწილი, Chapter or
  Part plus one number word. Chapters numbered only "I" or "1.", and sections such as
  Prologue or ეპილოგი, stay as text.
- **Footnotes at the foot of a page are removed, not linked.** Only notes collected in
  a notes section are linked.
- **Verse needs at least four lines.** Shorter verse, such as couplets, reads as text.
  Letters come out as ordinary paragraphs.
- **Bold, italics and pictures inside the book are not kept yet.**
- **Only Georgian and English** are detected. Other languages need `--language`.
