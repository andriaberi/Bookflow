"""Spaces where the page shows them, whatever space characters the PDF has.

Some PDFs place each word where it belongs but leave out the spaces between them,
some leave out only a few, and some put a space of no width wherever a word may be
split across lines. Their fonts' widths may be wrong too, so the letters' boxes
overlap and show no gap. Where each letter starts is still right, though: inside a
word a letter always moves the next one along by the same amount, and a word break
moves it by a space more.
